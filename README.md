# Base-Solana Bridge Benefits for Future Onchain Markets 🚀

The Dec 4, 2025 bridge launch connects Base (cheap DeFi) and Solana (fast apps) – huge for inevitable onchain growth.

## Key Benefits
- Low Fees: Under $1 bridges – moves USDC/ETH without losing 5-10% like old ways.
- Speed: 1-3 mins – real-time trades across chains, no waits.
- Liquidity: $500M+ bridged already – boosts TVL for both (Base $12B, Sol $15B).

## For Future Markets
- Inevitable Onchain: Bridges make hybrid apps (e.g., Sol games + Base yields) – grows user base 2x.
- Adoption: Easier for newbies – one wallet for memes on Sol + LPs on Base.
- Risks to Watch: Security first – use official like Across to avoid hacks.
